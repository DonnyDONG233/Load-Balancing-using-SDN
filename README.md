# Load-Balancing-using-SDN
Worked on Floodlight Controller and Mininet to implement the load balancer in python using Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path algorithm, increased bandwidth and efficiency of network by 300%.
ProjectGroup10_Topology.py is the custom network topology consisting of 12 hosts and 14 switches implemented using Python.
This network topology is built using Mininet.
CMPECode210-ProjectGroup10.py is the Load Balancing script implemented in Python.
